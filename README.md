# Maps - Multiple BView Concept
Here is a concept for future use, there's another concept by [**@pulkomandy**](https://github.com/pulkomandy)

> Instead of moving the view itself, I would suggest to use SetTransform to modify how the bitmap is rendered. You can use the BTransform class to create zooms and translations easily.
